          <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#15803d]">Aquaculture</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">FarmsMed’s mission in aquaculture is to transform the sector through a
            synergistic focus on advanced medicines, targeted nutritional solutions, and intelligent automation. Facing
            high mortality rates, fragmented services, and productivity losses, FarmsMed delivers region-specific
            chemical and herbal medicines that are up to 87% more effective than generic alternatives, actively tailored
            to the disease profiles and water parameters unique to each geography. This scientific edge gives farmers
            powerful tools to prevent disease and ensure healthy growth.</p>

          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"></p>  In nutrition, FarmsMed offers mineral supplements, probiotics, and feed additives designed to enhance feed
            conversion, boost immunity, and maximize yield. These solutions, customized for both shrimp and fish
            species, drive consistent quality and profitability for farmers.</p>

          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"></p>  On the automation front, FarmsMed leverages IoT-powered pond monitoring, smart aerators, dosing systems, and
            predictive analytics—aiming for a future where complex pond management, disease detection, and feeding are
            executed entirely by machines.</p>

          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"></p>  The vision is clear: zero human involvement in operational tasks, allowing farmers to focus on growth and
            management decisions. By blending science-based products with data-driven automation, FarmsMed delivers an
            integrated ecosystem that sets a new standard for sustainable and profitable aquaculture.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded shadow">
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#15803d]">Agriculture</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">FarmsMed’s future in agriculture centers on integrating proprietary medicines,
            precise nutrition products, and smart automation to overcome the major hurdles faced by Indian farmers. The
            core mission is to bring cutting-edge plant health solutions—bioactive herbal medicines, robust crop
            protectants, and advanced plant growth regulators—directly to the field, localizing product innovation for
            India’s diverse climates and crops.</p>

          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">In nutrition, FarmsMed elevates productivity through meticulously crafted
            biostimulants, soil enhancers, and crop-specific supplements designed to optimize yield and resilience in
            fluctuating environmental conditions. These products are supported by rigorous field trials and scientific
            validation, making FarmsMed synonymous with trustworthy, effective nutrition.</p>

          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">On the automation front, FarmsMed intends to deploy advanced tools such as
            robotic planters, sensor-controlled irrigation systems, and AI-driven pest control mechanisms. These
            innovations aim to redefine agricultural efficiency by combining precision technology with sustainable
            practices.</p>

          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Looking ahead, the company’s ambitious goal is to achieve zero human
            intervention in core farming operations. With every task—from sowing to harvesting—automated, farmers can
            devote themselves to strategic oversight and value addition, ensuring heightened efficiency and
            sustainability across the agricultural landscape. </p>

          <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#15803d]">Farms Automation</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">FarmsMed’s automation division is at the forefront of revolutionizing Indian
            farming, with a bold vision to eliminate manual involvement across aquaculture, poultry, and dairy. This
            means building fully autonomous systems where daily routines—feeding, monitoring, dosing, cleaning, and
            health management—are executed by advanced robotics and real-time analytics.

          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">  In aquaculture, IoT-enabled sensors, smart feeders, and self-regulating water treatment units create a
            completely hands-free operation, with alerts, data insights, and optimization handled by proprietary
            software dashboards. These intelligent systems ensure consistency, reduce errors, and enable farmers to
            manage their operations remotely with confidence.

          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">  Similar automation architectures are being extended seamlessly to poultry and dairy, where environmental
            controls, automated milking, precision feeding, and digital health diagnostics ensure that farm management
            is not only simplified but entirely automated. This cross-sector integration builds efficiency and
            reliability into every aspect of farming.

          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"> The vision of zero human involvement reflects FarmsMed’s deep commitment to reliability, scalability, and
            future-ready farming. In this new paradigm, farmers become stewards of strategy and decision-making, while
            machines guarantee consistency, risk reduction, and higher profits. FarmsMed’s automation is not just
            feature-rich—it represents a fundamental shift in how food will be produced across India.

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded shadow">
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#15803d]">Dairy</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">In the dairy sector, FarmsMed seeks to redefine farm management through
            innovative veterinary medicines, high-performance nutritional supplements, and full process automation. The
            mission is to elevate both animal welfare and farm economics by introducing scientifically-developed herbal
            medicines, targeted probiotics, and regional formulations that support disease resistance, digestive health,
            and optimal milk yield.On the nutrition side, FarmsMed will offer mineral blends, specialized feed mixes,
            and enzyme supplements crafted for Indian breeds and climate conditions—empowering dairy farmers to achieve
            consistent growth and quality.Embracing automation, FarmsMed’s long-term plan is to deploy IoT-based milking
            robots, automated feeders, and smart climate control systems, pursuing absolute zero human involvement in
            daily dairy operations. This approach will guarantee operational precision, minimize stress for animals, and
            maximize productivity.FarmsMed’s vision for dairy is both ambitious and holistic: to merge the best
            medicines, nutrition, and hands-free automation, transforming India’s dairy farms into sustainable,
            world-class enterprises.</p>
